# USB MSD Validation

## Overview

This shell script executes on the DUT (Device-Under-Test) and verifies USB Mass Storage Devices (MSD).
The test validation scope includes:
- Successful enumeration of MSD devices
- For each device:
  - Determine and report bound transport driver (`uas` or `usb-storage`) from the MSD interface for debug visibility
  - Discover associated block devices via sysfs
  - If block device is missing, print device information to facilitate debug
- Print a table of enumerated devices:

```
DEVICE    VID:PID   DRIVER            PRODUCT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<dev>     <vid:pid> <uas|usb-storage> <product>
```
The test PASS requires all detected MSD devices to have associated block device nodes.

## Setup

- Connect USB MSD peripheral(s) to USB port(s) on DUT.
- Only applicable for USB ports that support Host Mode functionality. 
- USB MSD peripherals examples: USB flash drive, external HDD/SSD, etc.

## Usage
### Instructions:
1. **Copy the test suite to the target device** using `scp` or any preferred method.
2. **Navigate to the test directory** on the target device.
3. **Run the test script** using the test runner or directly.

---

### Quick Example
```
cd Runner
./run-test.sh usb_msd
```
